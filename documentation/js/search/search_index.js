Angular has an Injector that manages dependencies declared as providers.If a component or service needs another class, Angular\n         looks for that class in the injection tree, creates it (if necessary), and delivers it.\n         Any class marked with the &#64;Injectable() decorator can be a dependency.\n         \n          Angular allows you to control the scope of the injected instance:\n          \n            providedIn: 'root': Global singleton, available throughout the application and Only one instance.\n            providedIn: 'platform' (Advanced): Available across the entire platform, even beyond multiple Angular apps on the same page.\n            providedIn: 'any': A new instance for each lazy-loaded module and useful for isolating services between modules.\n            providedIn: 'self' / SkipSelf (advanced): Controls which level of the Angular injector to resolve the dependency and used in\n              conjunction with &#64;Optional, &#64;Self, &#64;SkipSelf, etc.\n          \n        \n         In addition to providedIn, Angular also allows you to declare providers in various places: &#64;Injectable( providedIn: 'root' ),\n           providers: [] in a component, providers: [] in a module and Injector.create()\n          Manual or advanced injection: Injecting custom tokens, injecting values ​​(useValue), Injecting concrete classes (useClass) and\n        Injecting factories (useFactory)\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        Observables are values on a stream of data and are great for managing events or streamed data.\n        Signals are values on a container and are great for managind the applicationstate. \n        This is the example of an buld in observable: {{regularInterval}}\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          HTTP Requests in Angular allow your application to communicate with external servers to send or receive data, such as:\n          \n            Retrieving information from a REST API, Submitting forms, Saving data to a database, Authentication, etc. \n          \n        \n        \n          Types of HTTP Requests:\n          \n            GET: Obtains data from the server. Used to read information, such as a list of users or products.\n            POST: Sends data to the server. Used to create new resources (for example, registering a user).\n            PUT: Completely replaces an existing resource. Used when you want to update an entire object.\n            PATCH: Partially updates a resource. Use it when you only want to change some fields of the object.\n            DELETE: Deletes a resource from the server.\n          \n        \n      \n\n      \n      \n        Click on me to learn more about HTTP requests with images!\n      \n    \n    \n      \n        \n          Guards types\n          \n            CanMatch: Decides whether a route can be used by the router before it is even evaluated whether it can be activated or loaded.\n            CanActivate: Determines whether a route can be activated. This is useful for protecting routes that should only be accessible to authenticated users or those with certain permissions.\n            CanDeactivate: Controls whether a user can exit a route.

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\nExample :ng generate component component-nameFor a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:\nExample :ng generate --helpBuilding\nTo build the project run:\nExample :ng buildThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\nRunning unit tests\nTo execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:\nExample :ng testRunning end-to-end tests\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\nExample :ng e2eAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default.
